# im-done-app
Web application to notify teachers when the majority of the class is done with example prompts

- "I'm done" is a simple application that lets teachers create a virtual room for their students.  
- The teacher can then create a task for the students to do and post it in the room
- Students can then log into the virtual room and check off when they have finished the task.
- The teacher's view will have a /pie chart/graph/total of the total number of students or percentage of the students that have finished the task
- optionally the students can raise a flag if they need help from the teacher, TA, or fellow classmate
